<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis1Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The increasement and decreasement of the regression:<br />
    <p>
      -The linear regression stars at 100 KWH but there is an increase until it
      reaches 700 KWH.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    The relation among the dots regarding the colors: <br />
    <p>
      -The red points are close but not above the linear regression.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that: <br />
    <p>-y=(117.73)(200)+-251.38=23294.62 <br /></p>

    <p>-R=/ The energy that will be consumed in a unit is 23294.62 KW <br /></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables:<br />
    <p>
      People who live with 3 and 4 people consume and have their red points
      between 100 and 200 KWH, except for a family of 8 people that the red
      point reaches up to 700 KWH. <br />
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
