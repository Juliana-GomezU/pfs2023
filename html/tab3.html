<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis2Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression:</li>
  <br />
    -The linear regression is presented starting from 120 KWH y increases to 210
    KWH.
    <li>
      <p>-The relation among the dots regarding the colors:<br /></p>
    </li>
    -The red points do not have an order and are very irregular.<br />
    <li>
      Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where
      $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that: <br />
      <p>- y=(32.29)(200)+49.57=6507.57 <br /></p>

      <p>
        - R=/ The energy that will be consumed in a unit is 6507.57 KW <br />
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
      between these two variables: <br />
    </li>
  </p>

  <p></p>
</ul>
